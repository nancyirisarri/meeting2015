<h2>Date and Location</h2>

<p>The meeting will be held on Thursday and Friday, July 2nd and 3rd at the 
Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen. The main meeting room is lecture 
room 0161 in the the Kapteynborg building on the Zernik Campus.</p>

<h3>Travel to Groningen and venue</h3>

<p>From Amsterdam international airport Schiphol Groningen is easily reached by 
train. At 3 minutes past every hour there is a direct train, while at 33 minutes 
past every hour the train with destination Leeuwarden can be used, with a 
change-over to the train to Groningen in Zwolle. Total travel time is 
2 hours 11 minutes, barring occasional delays.<br />
<b>Important:</b> If you plan to make extensive use of public transport in the 
Netherlands (e.g., train + bus), then it may be worth buying an 
<a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/?taal=en" target="_new">OV-chip card</a> 
at any train station. The card has an activation fee of 7.50 euros, but it 
offers you a discount on bus tickets and the convenience of not having to 
purchase paper tickets on busses and trains. You can charge the card by 
checking in and out with your card on special card-reading machines located 
on busses and in train stations. </p>

<p>The Zernike campus is located on the Northern outskirts of Groningen. From 
the train station or the city center the campus can be reached by bus lines 11 
and 15. The stop closest to the Kapteynborg is called "Nijenborg". Visit the 
<a href="http://www.9292.nl/en" target="_new">9292.nl</a> website for information 
on bus schedules. The regular ticket is 2 euros (one way), or slightly less if you 
have purchased an 
<a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/?taal=en" target="_new">OV-chip card</a>.<br />
When exiting the bus at the "Nijenborg" bus stop the Kapteynborg is on the other 
side of the street, see the map below.</p>
